## Review of the guide

The guide was very easy to understand and gave a very good overview of Unity and its possibilities. The tutorial used a simple roll
a ball game as an example so that newcommers would be able to fully enjoy making a simple game, which could work on any platform (with some minor changes in the script files). The guide's code was changed a little during the making of this game due to the requirement of being an Android app (handling the user's input).
